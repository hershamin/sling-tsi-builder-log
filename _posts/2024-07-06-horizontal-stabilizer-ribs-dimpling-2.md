We finished dimpling the horizontal stabilizer ribs, after getting the replacement parts from the airplane factory, additionally, we had to make some tool changes such as grinding the dimple die edge a little, in order to get consistent dimples.

## Tools
In order to get consistent dimples, especially in hard to reach places, the female part of the dimple die was sanded a little from one side using a grinding wheel. Additionally, with the impact dimpler, it helps to listen for a distinct sound of metal impacting, which means the die completely formed the dimple, and no further impact should be needed.
