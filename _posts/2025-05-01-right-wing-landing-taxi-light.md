Right wing landing and taxi light have been installed, it was pretty straightforward, required some additional tools such as a gel based superglue to put the springs in place while the lights are getting installed. Additionally, crimp + heat shrink ring terminals were used at the end of the wires to attach them to the lights. Also, since the holes where the light cover was installed were dimpled, a non-traditional method had to be invented to remove the dimples, more in the photos section.
