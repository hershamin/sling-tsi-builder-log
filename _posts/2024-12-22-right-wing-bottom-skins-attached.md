We finished attaching the bottom skin to the right wing skeleton structure. The assembly was very straightforward. With the wing jig in place, it was very easy for the skin pieces to attach section by section.

## Dimpling
Before attaching the skin sections, they were dimpled according to the instructions

## Assembly Process
The sequence of riveting was from root to tip, section by section. Each section in this case is defined as the rectangular area between 2 ribs. The assembly was straightforward, there was one rivet which required shortening due to obstruction created by the rib supporting the bell crank mechanism for the ailerons.
