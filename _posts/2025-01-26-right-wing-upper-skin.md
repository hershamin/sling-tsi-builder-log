We finished assembling the remaining right wing upper skin as well as the leading edge skin on the tip which goes over the landing light. Additionally, in the end, all the rivet holes were filled.

## Dimpling
The upper skin panel and the leading edge root skin which goes over the landing lights were dimpled.

## Upper Skin
Riveting the upper skin was pretty straightforward, the method which helped a lot was to rivet section by section starting with the rectangle sections at the root, then eventually to the tip. All the rivets on the trailing edge had to be shortened as per the instructions, in order to allow clearance for flaps and ailerons. The dimpled holes required enlarging the holes with appropriate sized drill bit.

## Upper Skin - Root
The root part of the upper skin was pretty stuff compared to the rest of it, so it took a little muscle power and a lot of clecos to keep it together, while being riveted. The strategy here was to rivet from trailing edge to the leading edge.

## Leading Edge Tip Skin
The leading edge tip skin required some muscle power in combination with a ratcheting tie down to bend it and cleco in order to rivet it. The dimpled holes required enlarging the holes with appropriate sized drill bit.
