We finished riveting for the elevator tip skins, which involved the fiberglass tips as well. Additionally, inspection hatch was also added to the bottom of the left side skin.

## Assembly
Assembly using clecos was pretty straightforward, a good amount of holes needed cleaning with a *3.2mm* drill bit. The sequence here was to cleco from rear to front of the skin, and doing one side at a time. Additionally, the fiberglass tips also needed holes to be drilled, along with countersinking the front holes to account for flat finish rivets.

## Riveting
Skin tip got riveted in place after the fiberglass tips were drilled and countersunk. Other than slightly enlarging the holes, riveting was pretty straightforward.

### Inspection Hatch
Assembling and riveting the inspection hatch was pretty straightforward, the key thing was to stick the protective coating on the hatch itself before adding the doubler. Photos below in sequence represents the assembly process.

## Center Counterweights Service Bulletin
As described in the photo below, the center counterweights were not added to the elevator. According to a notification from sling aircraft [Notification #0009](/assets/files/Notification-0009-10122021-Removal-of-Elevator-Centre-Balance-Weights.pdf), it helps with the CG and some minor flight stability fixes without the center counterweights, so keeping that in mind, we choose to simple not install them.
