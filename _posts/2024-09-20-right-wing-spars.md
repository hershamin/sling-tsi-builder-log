We finished assembly the spars for the right wing. The front spar came fully assembled by sling aircraft, and the Rear spar is mostly complete.

## Front Spar
The front spar came fully assembled by Sling. The holes and the top and the bottom were all countersunk, which saves a lot of time and repetition.

## Rear Spar
The rear spar assembly was pretty straightforward, some holes required cleaning up a bit. Assembly is complete for the most part with the exception to the spar to skin channel, which will be installed after installing the ribs, since before that it would be difficult to rivet the ribs.
