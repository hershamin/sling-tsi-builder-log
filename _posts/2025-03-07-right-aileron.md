The assembly of the right wing aileron is finished. It required doing a few dimples. The only thing that is left is to pull the final rivets, which will be done once it is ready for alignment time with the rest of the right wing assembled. Clecoeing and riveting was pretty straightforward. Bottom skin was done first then the top skin, going from the trailing edge to the leading edge on the top skin and the reverse on the bottom skin.
