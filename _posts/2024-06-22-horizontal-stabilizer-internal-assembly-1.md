We started partially riveting the _ribs_ to the already assembled _spars_ for the horizontal stabilizer, especially for the ones that did not require any dimpling, and also for some brackets on the trailing edge spar which does not require any rib attachments on the opposite side of that spar.

## Ribs Assembly
Before riveting the ribs to the spars, they were held together using clecos, check the images below.

## Center Ribs Riveting
Some ribs that did not need dimpling such as the center ribs are permanently riveted to the front and rear spars.

## Some Brackets Riveting
Brackets that did not need attachment to the opposite side of the rear spar were permanently riveted to the rear spar.
