The assembly for the horizontal stabilizer left side skin is complete. This also concludes the assembly of the horizontal stabilizer. We followed the same sequence in riveting as the right skin, which has been described in the previous article. The skin was dimpled as well, very similar to right side.

## Trim Servo Wiring
Before clecoing the skin, the wiring for the elevator trim servo was placed through the ribs using the provided rubber grommets.
