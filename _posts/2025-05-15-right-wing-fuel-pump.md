Right wing fuel pump has been mounted, additionally some plumbing had to be done. The fuel fittings were tightened until snug, and/or until they turned to 1.5 hex flats, after hand tightening. Torque seal indicator was applied on each fitting for future inspection. Additionally, a fuel filter was installed upstream of the pump.
