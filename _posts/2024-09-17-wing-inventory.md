We finished inventory for the Wing kit, found almost all the items, even some back ordered ones such as LED landing lights, center rib, etc.

## Organizing parts
Other than the pictures below, some parts such as the *fuel tank ribs*, *fuel tank hardware*, *wires*, *landing lights*, and *installation hardware* are organized in small boxes with easy access.

## Assembling right wing jig
Assembly for the right wing jig was pretty straightforward. I will also be using some `AN-7` hardware to mount the spars to the jig.
