We finished the wiring for the right wing lights before closing the wing. Plenty of precautions were taken to make sure the wires are secure and safe from chaffing.

For the nav lights and strobes, the provided shielded 4 core 18 awg wire was used, whereas for the taxi and landing light provided 16 awg wire was used, and each light had a corresponding black return line.

Additionally, for the taxi and landing lights, each wire was twisted using a drill, then covered with braided sheeving for extra protection. Twisting wires also make them neater and makes it easy to identify for which components the wires belong to.
