We finished sub-assemblies for some of the wing ribs that needed that, and in the process we ended up doing it for both the right wing and the left wing. For one of the ribs, the bracket for the flaps was bent in the wrong direction, so the parts department at Torrance has been notified to send a replacement.

## Rib 1 Assembly
Rib 1 sub-assembly was pretty straightforward, some holes required cleaning up as usual. The flap torque tube bushing rotates within the rib assembly, which I sent a note to sling technical for clarification.

## Rib 6 Assembly
Rib 6 sub-assembly was pretty straightforward, some holes required cleaning up as usual. There was some dimpling involved as well. The case for the torque tube bushing is same as Rib 1.

## Rib 8 Assembly
Rib 8 sub-assembly was pretty straightforward, some holes required cleaning up as usual. There was some dimpling involved as well. The flap angle bracket for the Right side rib was bent in the wrong direction, so a request for replacement has been sent to the Torrance parts department. The left side is completely assembled, will finish the right side once the replacement arrives.

## Rib 11 Assembly
Rib 11 sub-assembly was pretty straightforward, some holes required cleaning up as usual. There was some dimpling involved as well. Additionally, the bell crank assembly for the aileron torque tube was bolted to the proper torque settings.
