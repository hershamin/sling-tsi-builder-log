## Rib 11
Rib 11 was pretty straightforward, it required some extra rivets as expected due to it being the key pivot point for the aileron control rods.

Rib 12 was pretty straightforward as well, nothing special other than regular riveting.

## Rib 13
Rib 13 consisted of landing light channel which was painted a bit since it will be visible through the landing light lens. The assembly for the center rib and the leading edge rib was pretty straight forward.

### Landing Light Channel
Landing light channel had some rivnuts for attaching the lights themselves.
