The assembly of the right wing flap is finished. For this one, we decided to not do the dimples. While doing a small test fit experiment, it was determined that the dimples are not needed to reduce obstruction with the wing trailing edge.

## Internal Ribs
The Internal ribs of the flap required some sub-assemblies, which was pretty straightforward.

## Skin
Assembling the skin was pretty straight forward, the strategy for applying clecos as well as the rivets was to start at the bottom, then at the top starting from the trailing edge to the leading edge.
