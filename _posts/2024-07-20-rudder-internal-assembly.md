We finished assembly for the rudder internal structure. The process was pretty straightforward, and also required some minor dimpling in the process. Additionally, a few holes needed to be cleaned up with a `3.2mm` drill bit.

## Top Rib
Assembling the top rib was pretty straightforward, along with some hole cleaning.
