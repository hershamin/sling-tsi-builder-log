The testing of the right tank has been completed, it was done using a compression fitting on the vent tube with a low pressure gauge and covering the fuel intake and return lines with an6 block off fittings. Additionally, a bicycle pump was used to pressure the tank. Some assemblies were wrapped up as well such as screwing the fuel drain port as well as torquing the sender plate bolts to `20 in-lb`.
