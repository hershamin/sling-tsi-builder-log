title: Right Wing Main Spar Reinforcement
description: While, applying upper and lower skins, we initially forgot to add the reinforcement plates, so had to drill out a good amount of the rivets, and add the plates.

Checking back on the KAI, we realized that reinforcement plates on the lower and the upper flange of the main spar were not installed. They are supposed to be placed before riveting the skins, however in this case, the skins were already riveted, so had to remove (drill out) a good amount of the rivets, remove the leftover large rivet pieces from inside the wings using a magnet on a flexible stick inserted through the end of the wing as well as the inspection hatch.
