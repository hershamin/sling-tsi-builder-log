We assembled, riveted, and sealed the right wing fuel tank. It was a very long process, and a small test was done in between as well, with some water. The tank will be curing for about a week before doing a pressure test. Also, before riveting the tank, it was temporary clecoed on to the wing in order to clear drill the holes.
