We finished the left wing internal skeletal structure. The process was very straightforward, considering some work has been done ahead of time such as rib sub-assemblies being completed along with right wing, and also muscle memory from the right wing. The process overall was similar to the right wing, refer to those post references for more details, in the [Right Wing References](#right-wing-references) section.

## Wing Ribs Attachment
Wing ribs were attached without the rear spar initially which made the process a lot faster.

# Rear Root Ribs Attachment
Attaching root ribs required bending them temporarily as described in the pictures below, so the riveting equipment can be used.

## Rear Spar Attachment
Assembling the rear spar was pretty straightforward, in order to do it effectively, it was riveted after the ribs were riveted.
