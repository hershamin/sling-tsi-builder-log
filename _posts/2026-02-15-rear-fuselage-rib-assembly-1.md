We started assembling the fuselage, starting with the rear fuselage, as per the instructions. This post talks about rib assembly 1 in the rear fuselage.

## Rib 9
Rib 9 was straightforward, only thing which required some tricky efforts was adding nut plates where the vertical and the horizontal plates meet. Additionally, extra hole had to be drilled to account for the 180 degree nut plates provided, the holes were originally made for 90 degree nut plates.

## Final Assembly
Final assembly of the Rear rib assembly 1 required riveting all the previous sub-assemblies listed here, which was pretty straightforward. One rib required adding 2 bolts with the correct torque settings.
