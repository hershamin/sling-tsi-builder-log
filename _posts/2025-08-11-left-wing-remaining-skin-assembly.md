We finished dimpling, and riveting the upper skin as well as the landing light skin to the wing structure. Additionally, some parts which cannot be accessible after such as the inside of the landing light area was painted.

## Upper Skin
Assembling and riveting the upper skin was pretty straightforward, the strategy to rivet the leading and trailing edge boundary first, then for the center rivets, go from root to the tip.

## Landing Light Skin
Landing light skin was also straightforward to rivet, the skin section was bent properly, however some tow strap also had to be used in order to hold the skin in place while clecoeing the assembly.
