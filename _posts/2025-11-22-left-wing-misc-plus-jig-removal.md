We finished installing some left wing parts such as end rib as well as fuel pump and the rib holding it. Additionally, the wing was removed from the jig as well. The assembly was pretty straightforward, very similar to the right wing.

## Fuel Pump
The fuel pump was attached to the fuel tank root rib, same as the right wing.

Riveting the end rib was straightforward, same as the right wing, similarly it was painted prior to assembly.
