We finished assembly for the vertical stabilizer internal structure. The process was pretty straightforward, and also required some dimpling in the process.

## Dimpling
The dimpling for the ribs were pretty straightforward. The front spar came dimpled in the kit.

## Rear Spar Assembly
Rear spar required assembling some doublers along with having rivnuts in them, which is described in a sub-section below.

### Rivnuts
We had to install some rivnuts for the rear spar, which I'm assuming is probably for fairings down the line.

## Ribs Assembly
Assembling the ribs was pretty straightforward, some holes had to be cleaned up with a `3.2mm` drill bit.

### Top Rib
The top rib was not riveted to the spar since we will be installing a `Rami AV-12L Nav antenna` in the tail fin.

## Tools
A new tool was used for installing rivnuts, amazon link can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/YUZES-Cordless-Electric-Including-Carrying/dp/B0CG221C47). This tool is a drill attachment that we used with our cordless drill.
