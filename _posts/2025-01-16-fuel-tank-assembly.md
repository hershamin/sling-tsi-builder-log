We temporarily assembled both the fuel tanks with clecos. They were a little difficult however with some stretching of the skin and muscle power, it worked. That being said, the assembly is set aside while the rest of the wing is being worked on. This way, it will be easier to cleco and rivet the skin later since it might not require muscle power then.

Along with that, we also installed the rivnuts to the fuel tank skins with a steel epoxy.
