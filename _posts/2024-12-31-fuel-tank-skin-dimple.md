We dimpled both the right and left wing fuel tank skins. The process was pretty straightforward requiring some people which made it lot faster using our impact dimpler.

We also ran into an issue related to a skin tear which is a hole accidentally done using the dimple dies. Currently, the plan is to clean up the hole and then rivet it but also dip the rivet in pro-seal for good sealing. Using the pro-seal might not be necessary since the hole is on the side of the tank which does not hold any fuel.

I will email the builder support team to see what can be done about this as well, and post an update on this post.
