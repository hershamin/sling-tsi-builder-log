This is a very short post with some images of the riveting done on the elevator inboard skins. These skins represent all elevator skins other than the tip area where the fiberglass tips will also go in the near future.

## Riveting
The riveting for the skins was pretty straightforward. Most rivets were easy to install, some required cleaning up the holes a bit with a 1/8" drill bit. The sequence was from inboard to outboard flipping each side as we go forward.
