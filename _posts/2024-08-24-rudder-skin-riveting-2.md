We riveted the whole rudder skin, only top one was left from the previous blog. Additionally, red tail beacon was also wired and installed on top of the fiberglass tip.

## Tail Beacon Installation
Installing the tail beacon consisted of two parts, the bulb socket itself and the wiring that went with it. We used some epoxy.

### Bulb Socket
Installing the bulb socket required some drilling using step drill bits, along with using some epoxy to join the rivnuts to the fiberglass tip.

### Wiring
Installing the wiring required installing some snap bushings to protect the wires along with braided sleeving. Additionally, solder sleeves with heat shrink were used to join the wires.

## Top Skin Riveting
Riveting the top skin was pretty straightforward, some holes needed to be cleaned up using a `3.2mm` drill bit. An extra rivet was added on both sides of the trailing edge for additional re-enforcement.
