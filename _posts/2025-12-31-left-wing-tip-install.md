We installed the left wing tip, the process was very straightforward, initially it was positioning the tip at 2 key points as stated in the manual and similar to the right wing tip. Then, after drilling the holes, needed to countersink them on the tip, and dimple the skin sections where the tip will be installed using a hand dimpler. Once everything was done, the tip was riveted to the wing skins, after passing the wing tip strobe/position light cable through the installation hole.
