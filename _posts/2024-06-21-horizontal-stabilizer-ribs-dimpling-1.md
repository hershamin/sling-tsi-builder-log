We started dimpling for the horizontal stabilizer **ribs**, using the _impact dimpling tool_ from Aircraft Spruce, details regarding the tool is provided in the _Tools_ section at the bottom.

**Update:** Some dimple mishaps have been reported to sling technical and their response is in the relevant sections. Additionally, it was determined that the damage to the _1/8"_ dimple die caused some cracks, which was reported to airplane factory, and a replacement die is on the way.


## Ribs
While dimpling the ribs using the impact tool, we ran into some mishaps such as the dimples being off-center and also some crack due to the impact getting misaligned for a second. Below images are from how the normal dimples came out.

### Off-center dimples
Some dimples (images below) came out to be a little off-center, I sent questions to _sling technical_, will update this post when I get some answers.

**Update:** Sling technical department recommended replacing the parts, since the rivet flanges on the skin can protrude a bit. Additionally, it was determined that the dimple die was too big for that opening, so I will grind the edge of the dies a bit, so they fit flat against the hole.

### Cracked dimple
Very few dimples (images below) came out to be slightly cracked, I sent questions to _sling technical_, will update this post when I get some answers.

**Update:** Sling technical department mentioned that I definitely need to replace these parts. This was reported via _Sling Shot_ to the factory, and replacement for cracked parts is on the way.

## Skin Sample
We tried this tool on the skins as well, the dimples came out to be great, since the placement for skin was flat with the tool compared to ribs.

## Tools
The dimpler we ended up using was the _impact dimpler_, which we used with a 2lb _dead blow hammer_. Using that kind of hammer is critical, since it has a sand ballast instead of hard metal, which will provide a smooth impact instead of a jerk like impact which you get from a regular hammer. The tool itself is from _Aircraft Spruce._, and the dead blow hammer is from _Harbor Freight._
