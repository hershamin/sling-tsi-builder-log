Right wing tip preparation was done, in terms of drilling holes, some were tricky due to them being hidden underneath the fiberglass, a hole finder tool had to be used. Wing tip placement was done according to the KAI.

## Wing tip placement
Wing tip placement was done using a long 2x4 wood block along the top of the wing on the main spar, and the top of the tip in that area was adjusted to be parallel to the long wood block.

## Leading Edge + Mid-section
Leading edge was pretty straight forward, after placing the wing tip in proper orientation, it was a matter of drilling holes using the skin as a template and clecoeing them starting off with the leading edge, alternating between top and bottom.

## Trailing Edge
Unlike the frontal wing sections, the trailing edge was a little tricky, a hole finder tool had to be used, and it was a very tight fit in between the rib flange and fiberglass tip. The method used to drill holes was to drill 2 holes first using the hole finder, then using a temporary tape as a template for drilling the remaining holes. Some holes came out to be slightly offset which enlarged the original holes, but that should not be a problem, since we have plenty of material for strength.
