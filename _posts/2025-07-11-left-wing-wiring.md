We finished wiring the left wing, as well as adding avionics such as regulated pitot tube, and outside air temperature probe. Some wires were twisted together to reduce EMI as well as a cleaner look.

## Lights
Wiring the lights for the nav/strobe lights as well as taxi/landing lights was pretty straightforward, same as the right wing. The power wires for landing and taxi lights were twisted using a drill, and covered in sheaving, to prevent from chaffing.

## Pitot Tube
Installing the pitot tube involved several things such as figuring out a mount for the heating controller, as well as installing grommets for the wiring as well as the pneumatic tubing for pitot and AoA.

## OAT Probe
Installing the Outside Air Temperature (OAT) probe involved riveting a doubler near the root inspection hatch. Additionally, a ground wire was also installed in addition to the OAT probe wire.

## Avionics
The two major avionics components installed in the left wing were the [OAT Probe](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/inpages/garmin_10-06970.php) and the [Heated/Regulated Pitot Tube](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/inpages/garmin_10-06970.php)

## Bonus
The wires are very neatly organized, and labeled, bonus images in this section.
