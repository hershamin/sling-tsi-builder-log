We finished testing, and sealing where leaks were found for the left side fuel tank. The process was tedious but got a lot of confidence in the end. The leaks were sealed using steel epoxy. The testing procedure was exact same as the right side fuel tank. In one of the photos, there will also be some rough math that was done to predict what the fuel loss might be in worst case scenario, which it came out to be less than a gallon per hour, which is not a problem, and can be accounted while flying.
