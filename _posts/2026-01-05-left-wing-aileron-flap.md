We assembled and riveted the flap as well as the aileron for the left wing, along with aligning it using the exact same process as the right wing. The process was pretty straightforward, not many surprises. This also marks the last rivets for the wing kit, which is a huge milestone.

## Aileron
Assembling the aileron required some rib subassemblies before proceeding with the skin. Some rivets along the leading edge longitudinal line were left out to be riveted during final alignment time on the wing.

## Alignment
Aligning the flap the aileron to the wing required mounting them on the brackets then riveting the alternate remaining rivets from the center then outboard alternating sides in between, while checking the alignment with the wing root and the tip as we go forward.

_Not enough spacing between the brackets which is causing the rivets to abrade against the hinge on the wing._

_Adding a thick nut plus washer in between, and leaving it overnight to widen the spacing between the brackets._
