We riveted the vertical stabilizer skin as well as installed a VOR antenna on the top of it, for navigation using radio signals, which will facilitate ILS approaches as well as VOR navigation.

## Internal Wiring
For internal wiring, two different cables were routed. One was the `coax` cable which came with the *VOR* antenna, and another were `18awg` power wires for the *tail beacon*. Both the wires were installed through the ribs using `1/4"` snap bushings. Additionally, the power wires were covered with a `braided sleeve`.

## Skin Riveting
Most of the skin was riveted to the internal structure with an except of the parts needed to install the VOR antenna rib. It was mostly straightforward, one of the holes developed some cracks, so it was sanded to stop the propagation of the cracks before riveting.

## VOR Antenna Installation
VOR antenna installation was a little challenging since this version of the antenna was a little wider to the point that it slightly stretched the rib, but not enough to prevent the skin from riveting. However, as a consequence of it, there was no space to install the rubber grommets, so instead `JB Weld` high heat epoxy was used, which also helped in avoiding ground loops, which we confirmed using a multimeter. Additionally, on the top rib where the VOR antenna was installed, a `doubler` was also used in between the Rib and the Antenna puck.

## Avionics & Tools
For the VOR antenna, we used [Rami AV-12L](https://www.rami.com/product/av-12l/) which comes with the cable and an integrated balun transmitter in it. Additionally, to label the wires we also bought a Portable [Label Maker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3L93F2Q), which uses thermal printing for durability.
